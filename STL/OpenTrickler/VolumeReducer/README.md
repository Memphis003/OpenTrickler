# The Volume Reducer

![preview](preview.png)
Inspired by [dirtbit's mod](../../../../CommunityContributions/dirtbit), the volume reducer is designed to reduce the space that the powder can go from the front and rear body of the OpenTrickler. 

The front and rear volume reducer is designed to replace the bearing_cover as well.
